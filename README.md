# Real-Time-Clock-Temperature-System
In industrial and home environments, temperature monitoring is critical to ensure safety. This project aims to simulate a real-time system that monitors temperature and time continuously, and alerts the user when temperature crosses a safe limit.
# Real-Time Clock and Temperature Monitoring System

## ðŸ§ª Overview
This Arduino-based project displays the current time and temperature using an RTC and DS18B20 sensor on a 16x2 I2C LCD. It shows alerts for HIGH or LOW temperatures.

## ðŸ”§ Components
- Arduino Uno
- DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
- RTC DS1307
- 16x2 LCD with I2C
- 4.7kÎ© Resistor

## ðŸ”Œ Circuit & Simulation
Simulate on Wokwi: [Open Project](https://wokwi.com/projects/your-project-id)

## ðŸ“„ Features
- Displays real-time clock
- Monitors temperature
- Alerts for:
  - High temperature > 30Â°C
  - Low temperature < 15Â°C

## ðŸ’» Code
